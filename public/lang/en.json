    "about_title": "About me",
    "about_text": "I'm originally from Paris, France but grew up in an interesting familly, to say the least. <br>First of all, my father came from Norway and my mother from Argentina, giving me the ability to grow up with three languages, which allows me to offer my tour in five languages today. <br> I also have a very musical familly, as my father is himself a professional musician, which made music be a part of my life since I'm a little child. My main education is classical violin, but I've also learned guitar, piano and singing duringing my childhood which makes me a polyvalent and versatile musician.",
    "about2_text": "The love of music was also one of the reasons I moved to Berlin, as this city has a lot to offer in that area with a lot of bars or alternative venues to perform and enjoy music. <br>I got into tourguiding two yeatrs ago, an activity I instantly loved doing, as I am also fascinated by the history of this city, and that was the moment I decided to combine my two passions. <br><br>That is how I created this unique tour where I not only cover the main history of the monuments and the city, but I add a song related to it in order to bring another dimention to the tour",
